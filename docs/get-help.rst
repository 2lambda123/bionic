Most Bionic development is done by `REDACTED-PERSON
<REDACTED-URL>`_,  so he's a good person to come to with
questions and feedback.  If you're asking on Slack, it's better to ask in
`REDACTED-CHANNEL <REDACTED-URL>`_ rather than via DM,
so other people can benefit from the discussion.  You can mention ``REDACTED-PERSON``
directly to get his attention.  ``REDACTED-PERSON``, ``REDACTED-PERSON``, and ``REDACTED-PERSON`` are
also knowledgeable about Bionic.

If you want to have a more in-depth discussion about Bionic, Janek would be
excited to talk to you -- feel free to put a 1:1 on his calendar.

Bugs can be filed under the `KP project
<REDACTED-URL>`_ and assigned to Janek.
