# Bionic

Bionic is a Python framework for building, running, and sharing data science
research workflows.

Bionic is currently in alpha.  It is suitable for small-to-medium-size research
projects, but probably not for large projects or in production code.  We will
attempt to keep the API backwards compatible as long as possible, but there
will probably be at least one breaking API change in the future.

Check out the [full documentation][1], or go straight to [Getting Started][2].
