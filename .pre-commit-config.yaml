        # Pre-commit does some static analysis by caching packages (can
        # be found in ~/.cache/pre-commit/). When used in a virtualenv
        # (like pyenv), flake8 does not work correctly withthe default
        # language and the custom dnode match linter breaks.
        # To get around this, pre-commit devs recommend to use it as a
        # "system" hook (default is "local"). See
        # https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks/issues/157
        # for more information on this issue.
